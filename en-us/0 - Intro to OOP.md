## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the organization of code around objects, units that represent entities of the real world. These objects have characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that interact with each other, providing a modular and efficient approach to software development. 

## History of OOP

Object-oriented programming emerged as an alternative to the characteristics of structured programming. Its purpose was also to bring the handling of the structures of a program closer to the handling of things in the real world, hence the name "object" as something generic, which can represent anything tangible.

The true popularization of OOP occurred in the 1980s, with languages such as Smalltalk and C++. Smalltalk pioneered the effective implementation of OOP concepts, while C++ brought the object-oriented approach to the C programming language, gaining wide acceptance in the industry.

Since then, OOP has become an essential paradigm in software development, influencing languages such as Python, Java, and C#, providing a more modular, flexible, and efficient way to organize code.

## Advantages of OOP

OOP offers several advantages, including:

1. Code Reusability: The ability to reuse classes and objects in different parts of the code, saving time and effort.

2. Structured Organization: The object-oriented structure facilitates the organization and maintenance of code, making it more understandable and scalable.

3. Encapsulation and Security: Encapsulation protects implementation details, preventing unauthorized access and improving code security.

4. Inheritance and Polymorphism: Inheritance allows new classes to be created based on existing classes, promoting code reuse. Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated in a uniform manner.

## History of Tibia

Tibia is an online role-playing game dating back to 1997, developed by CipSoft. Set in a medieval and magical world, Tibia allows players to explore, carry out missions, fight creatures and interact in a multiplayer environment.

## Why use Tibia in this Project?

The use of Tibia-inspired examples in this project aims to make OOP learning more engaging and practical. The Tibia universe offers a variety of entities, such as players, creatures and items, that can be modeled and manipulated using OOP concepts. Furthermore, Tibia is a familiar reference for many, making learning more accessible and interesting.

By exploring OOP principles through Tibia examples, readers have the opportunity to apply the concepts in a tangible way, providing a more captivating and applicable learning experience in developing real-world applications.
